This project is aiming to offer disabled users an easier time of navigating local infrastructure.

Features:
-personalized route preferences and profiles
-similar to Google Places - users can leave detailed reviews regarding accessibility and sentiment towards disabled ppl and share their experiences
	-such as parking, ramps, door widths, restrooms, and service attitude toward disabled individuals.
	- Users can “check in” at accessible locations, which also lets future users know how recently accessibility features were confirmed.
-similar to Google Routes, the path finding of this app takes into account the person's disability (they might prefer to take public transport even if they take longer as opposed to walking; they might prefer a walking route with no stairs, etc.)
-Provide an assisted navigation mode that gives turn-by-turn directions with additional audio and haptic feedback for visually impaired users.
-provide audio alerts for blind individuals when their bus/tram/subway has arrived.
-Provide detailed accessibility information for public transport options along the route (e.g., availability of ramps on buses, accessible train cars, low-floor bus schedules).
-markers for benches, disability parking
- allow users to report real-time or temporary obstacles along a route (e.g., construction sites, broken elevators, snow-covered ramps, etc.).
	-push notifications to inform users when new alerts come in for locations on their route.
-accessibility for color blindness
-optional (narrator for dyslexic ppl)
-Implement an SOS button that allows users to quickly notify emergency contacts or local authorities in case they need assistance.

-Incentivize users to leave reviews, confirm accessibility information, and report obstacles by implementing a points system with badges or rewards.
-Create pre-designed, accessible “tours” of local neighborhoods or areas that are especially accessible, such as museums, parks, or accessible restaurant routes.
-Create a user-driven support network where people with similar accessibility needs can share tips and offer advice for specific routes or destinations.
